The 2019 MIT IAP Computational Law course is a free, open, and digital-first class. The structure of the course involves a series of flipped-classroom lectures ([sessions](https://mitmedialab.github.io/2019-MIT-Computational-Law-Course/Sessions)) that have been pre-recorded on youtube live, on-going commentary through our [class telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/HT4a1hFg6GWbPJqtnqWwZg), and pidgeonhole widgets for providing synchronous and asynchronous feedback to lectures through comments, voting, and other real-time polling functions.

## Course Overview

This course provides a conceptual overview and hands-on projects for understanding and solving legal use cases with data analytics, blockchain or other cryptosystems and a special module on rapid design solutions to key challenges posed by the Open Music Initiative. The course includes seminar-style lecture/discussion sessions and hands-on, experiential learning through team projects. The course covers:
 
* Digital Assets, including 1) Ownership rights, valuation and provenance of digital property; and 2) Storage and exchange of digital property with electronic contracts, automated transactions and autonomous agents

* Digital Identity, including 1) Technology and architecture for autonomy and control of self-sourced digital identity and personal data; and 2) Using individual identity for valid, verifiable login to apps or services and for providing a legal acknowledgment, assent or authorization.

* Digital Contracts, including 1) Integrating ordinary digital contracts and blockchain "smart contracts" in automated transactions by individuals or businesses; and 2) Standard open-web stack design patterns for executing multiple digital signatures and electronic notarization on digital legal contracts.

The course includes tutorials and tools for prototyping with blockchain based smart contracts and computational modeling.  The course also includes a special module on Open Music use cases and student projects.
