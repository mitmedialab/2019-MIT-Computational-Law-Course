# Course Overview

This course provides a conceptual overview and hands-on projects for understanding and solving legal use cases with data analytics, blockchain or other cryptosystems and a special module on rapid design solutions to key challenges for challenges posed by the Open Music Initiative. The course includes seminar-style lecture/discussion sessions and hands-on, experiential learning through team projects. The course covers:
 
* Digital Assets, including 1) Ownership rights, valuation and provenance of digital property; and 2) Storage and exchange of digital property with electronic contracts, automated transactions and autonomous agents

* Digital Identity, including 1) Technology and architecture for autonomy and control of self-sourced digital identity and personal data; and 2) Using individual identity for valid, verifiable login to apps or services and for providing a legal acknowledgment, assent or authorization.

* Digital Contracts, including 1) Integrating ordinary digital contracts and blockchain "smart contracts" in automated transactions by individuals or businesses; and 2) Standard open-web stack design patterns for executing multiple digital signatures and electronic notarization on digital legal contracts.

The course includes tutorials and tools for prototyping with blockchain based smart contracts and computational modeling.  The course also includes a special module on Open Music use cases and student projects.

## The DDEX Standard

<img width="1054" alt="screen shot 2018-11-15 at 2 37 53 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2357755/48577032-165a3c00-e8e4-11e8-83d5-1fcb3100dd9f.png">

**Workshop course projects will include rapid prototyping of open source implementations of the DDEX standard.**

> DDEX is a consortium of leading media companies, music licensing organisations, digital service providers and technical intermediaries, focused on the creation of digital supply chain standards.

> To support the automated exchange of information along the digital supply chain, DDEX has standardised the format in which information is represented in XML messages and the method by which the messages are exchanged between business partners. These standards are developed and made available for industry-wide implementation.

> DDEX standards help rightsholders, retailers and technical intermediaries to more effectively communicate information along the digital supply chain. This leads to efficient business transactions, reduced costs and increased revenues for all sectors involved.

> Formed in 2006, DDEX initially focused on standardising message formats for the digital music supply chain but the foundation of the standards is sufficiently generic that they can easily be adapted to other digital media supply chains.

* DDEX free implementation licence terms: [http://ddex.net/ddex-implementation-licence-terms](http://ddex.net/ddex-implementation-licence-terms)
