Tech vs Money
https://www.atrium.co/blog/money-tech-crypto/

I took a course in which Alex Tapscott was a guest lecturer.
If you want to turn your world inside out and understand what all the fuss is about.
I recommend his book-

Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World

Re: A thought a person asked-
I think all cryptocurrencies will be gone in 10 years or less and if only one survives it's going to be Bitcoin.

I’m not sure how they define cryptocurrency. In the space there a cryptocurrency‘s, security tokens utility tokens and many more that have not been invented.... these are all (classes of ) and representations of exchange of value....

If you take the crypto currency alone
Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.-

The crypto currency class has 4 variants alone..... with different risk profiles and purposes:

1. Pure Currency-

There’s pure deflationary currency: bitcoin
Ethereum (Ethereum is actually more complex because is a value back in for smart contracts)

2. Stable coins pegged to a fiat currency
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin

3. Algorithmically Pegged coins which are peg to assets (this is more complex)

4. Privacy coins that include anonymous transfer.... These include the Zcash and Monero

So for pure crypto currency’s (not including security tokens, utility tokens and all sorts of other variants) there are 
the above 4 classes of crypto currencies. These provide different levels of security, transparency and risk.
